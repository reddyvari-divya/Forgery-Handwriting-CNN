# Forgery Numeral Handwriting Detection using CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.  
It simulates the concept of forgery detection by learning digit patterns and distinguishing them.
### Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
### Description
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 handwritten digits.  
It uses a CNN to learn and recognize digit patterns with high accuracy.  
Although this project doesn't use a real forgery dataset, it lays the foundation for future extension into numeral forgery detection.
### Features
- Handwritten digit classification (0â€“9)  
- Over 97% test accuracy  
- Real-time prediction with image display  
### How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reddyvari-divya/Forgery-Handwriting-CNN.git
   cd Forgery-Handwriting-CNN
